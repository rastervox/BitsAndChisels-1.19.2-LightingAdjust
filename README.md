Bits and Chisels is a Fabric mod for modern Minecraft that lets you remove small bits from blocks using chisels. You can use these bits to build detailed decorations or whatever else you want. Requires Fabric API. Has Canvas Renderer support for shaders. Uses greedy meshing and the Fabric Renderer API to achieve high FPS post-1.13 rendering changes. This mod was inspired by Chisel and Bits.

This is a quick fork I made when I wanted to make small lightbulb and lamp style lights, but the light value never got above 2. I don't know Java or Minecraft modding at all.
